<h1>I am stupid</h1>
<p>If you can read this, I made a small error in the configuration, this can be easly fixed by unpluging the powercable to the brown box and than pluging it back in (You can alternitivly just turn the powerbar off and back on again)

Give it a couple of hourse after this procedure, becouse i have to do some thing on the backend, but after that it should work flowlessly gor the rest of time.</p>

<p>I do know there and what the error is, i just cant correct it, becouse I dont have remote excess until the steps above have been completed.</p>
