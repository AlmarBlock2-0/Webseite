        <TLDR>
          TL;DR: The pump isn't working until it gets restarted, because I
          forgot to set one setting, while setting the whole system up.

    </div>
    <p>
      If you can read this, I made a small error in the configuration, this can
      be easly fixed, but in order to do that, someone is required to unpluging the
      powercable to the brown box and than pluging it back in (You can
      alternitivly just turn the powerbar off and back on again) Give it a
      couple of hourse after this procedure, becouse I have to do some thing on
      the backend, but after that it should work flowlessly for the rest of
      time. (I get a notification, once it has been power cycled.)
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I do know where and what the error is (and how to fix it), I just can't
      correct it, because I dont have remote excess until the steps above have
      been completed.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>The error</h2>
    <p>
      Since the Schools Internet is using a untrustet certificat, I had to use a
      detour that works by connecting to a VPN, that I controll. That VPN has a
      rolling ip, meaning that the ip of that server is changing daily, the
      server in the School, that controlls the pump, is just not aware about
      that rolling Ip, so I have to tell it, to check for chnages once in a
      while.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>DON'T PANIC</h2>
    <p>The waterlevel sould be fine for the next rougthly:</p>
    <div id="timer-container">
      <div id="timer"><p>00:00:00</p></div>
      <space>&nbsp;</space>
      <p style="font-style: italic">(28.12.2025 00:00 AM)</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      I might have turn of the automation after seeing that the pump ran for
      15min. straight, so the pump shouldn't need to be turned on for that
      amount of time.
    </p>

    <h2>One last hope</h2>
    <p>This might work, but it is very unlikely:</p>

      P.S. There is a small chance that it will fix itself on Wednesday, but I
      would put my hope on it.
