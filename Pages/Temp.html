  If you can read this, I made a small error in the configuration, this can be
  easly fixed, but in order to do it is someone required to unpluging the
  powercable to the brown box and than pluging it back in (You can alternitivly
  just turn the powerbar off and back on again) Give it a couple of hourse after
  this procedure, becouse I have to do some thing on the backend, but after that
  it should work flowlessly for the rest of time. (I get a notification, once it
  has been power cycle.)
</p>
<p>
  I do know where and what the error is (and how to fix it), I just can't
  correct it, because I dont have remote excess until the steps above have been
  completed.
</p>

<h2>The error</h2>
<p>
  Since the Schools Internet is using a untrustet certificat, I had to use a
  detour that works by connecting to a VPN, that I controll. That VPN has a
  rolling ip, meaning that the ip of that server is changing daily, the server
  in the School, that controlls the pump, is just not aware about that rolling
  Ip, so I have to tell it, to check for chnages once in a while.

<h2>A last hope</h2>
<p>This might work, but it is very unlikely:</p>

<p>P.S. There is a small chance that it will fix itself on Wednesday, but I would put my hope on it.</p>
